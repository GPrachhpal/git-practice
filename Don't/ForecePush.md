# Difference Between `--force` and `--force-with-lease` in Git

## 🔁 git push origin --force

What it does:

- Forces your local branch to overwrite the remote branch, regardless of what’s on the remote.

Risk:

- Can overwrite someone else’s changes if they pushed to the same branch after your last pull/fetch.
- No safety checks — it just pushes.

Use With Caution: Only use it when:

- You’re working alone on a branch.
- You know no one else has pushed to the branch since your last fetch.

## 🔐 git push origin --force-with-lease

What it does:

- Also forces the push, but only if the remote hasn't changed since your last fetch.
- Git checks the remote-tracking reference to make sure it’s the same as what you last saw.

Safer:

- Prevents you from accidentally deleting someone else's work.
- Ideal for collaborative branches.

Behind the scenes:
It's like saying:

> "Push only if no one has updated this branch on the remote since I last checked."

## 📊 Side-by-Side Comparison

| Feature                         | --force | --force-with-lease    |
| ------------------------------- | ------- | --------------------- |
| Overwrites remote branch?       | ✅ Yes  | ✅ Yes (only if safe) |
| Safety check on remote changes? | ❌ No   | ✅ Yes                |
| Risk of overwriting others?     | ⚠️ High | ⚠️ Low                |
| Suitable for shared branches?   | 🚫 No   | ✅ Yes                |
| Default for teams?              | ❌      | ✅ Preferred          |

## ✅ Recommendation:

Always use `--force-with-lease` unless you're absolutely sure it's safe to use `--force`.

## 🔁 Example (safe rebase workflow):

    git rebase main
    git push origin --force-with-lease

## 📝 My Takeaway

1. ✅ --force-with-lease is a safer way to force push.
2. 🚫 It prevents you from overwriting someone else’s changes that you haven’t seen.
3. ✅ Use --force-with-lease instead of --force in collaborative environments.
