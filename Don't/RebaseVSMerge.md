# Understanding `git merge` vs `git rebase` (from main)

## 📜 Commands

git checkout feature1
git rebase main
git checkout main
git merge feature1

## ❓ Question

Can I replace `git merge feature1` with `git rebase feature1` on `main`?

## ❌ Answer

No, you cannot simply do `git rebase feature1` when you are on the `main` branch to achieve the same effect as `git merge feature1`. Here’s why:

## 🔍 What Each Command Does

### ✅ `git merge feature1` (on `main`)

- Merges the changes from `feature1` into `main`.
- A new merge commit may be created (if there are new commits on both branches).
- The `main` branch will now include all the commits from `feature1`.

### ⚠️ `git rebase feature1` (on `main`)

- This command will rebase the `main` branch **on top of** `feature1`.
- It means: Git will take the commits unique to `main` and replay them on top of `feature1`, then move `main` to this new tip.
- This operation **rewrites the history of main**, which is dangerous for shared branches.

## 📌 Why This Matters

- Normally, you use `git rebase` to keep a **feature branch** up to date with the **main** branch.
- Rebasing `main` onto `feature1` is **unusual and risky**, especially if `main` is shared with your team.

## ✅ Correct Usage

To bring changes from `feature1` into `main`:

git checkout main
git merge feature1

If a fast-forward is possible and you want linear history:

git checkout main
git merge --ff-only feature1

## 📊 Summary Table

| Command | Effect |
| `git merge feature1` | Incorporates `feature1` changes into `main` (safe and standard) |
| `git rebase feature1` (on main) | Rewrites `main`'s history on top of `feature1` (not recommended) |

## 🧠 Bottom Line

**You should not replace `git merge feature1` with `git rebase feature1` on the `main` branch.**

- Use `merge` to bring the feature branch into `main`.
- Use `rebase` to update your feature branch with the latest from `main`.

## 📝 My Takeaway

1. ✅ Do rebasing on your **personal feature branches**.
2. 🚫 Don’t do it on **shared branches** like `main`, `dev`, `stage`, or `qa` as it **rewrites history**.
